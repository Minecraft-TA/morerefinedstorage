# Refined Storage

**Refined Storage is a mass storage mod for Minecraft that offers the player a network-based storage system, allowing them to store items and fluids on a massively expandable device network.**

Items and fluids can be stored in one of the many storage capabilities that the mod offers. Any storage devices connected to the same network are accessible to the player through one simple Grid interface, allowing the player to access the inventories of many devices through a single unified GUI.

This mod not only adds storage solutions, but also devices that can be used to manipulate items and blocks in the world and from within the system, such as importers, exporters, constructors, destructors, and more! There are also devices in this mod that allow the player to setup auto-crafting, allowing the crafting of complex recipes in a few simple clicks.

# More Refined Storage

This fork mainly focuses on performance improvements and useful feature additions to make your life easier.
Most notable additions are a completely new crafting engine, re-written from scratch with only performance and reliability in mind (it also comes closer to minecrafts actual crafting behavior than the old version) and new code for shift crafting in a crafting grid to make the server not crash anymore on big systems.

Builds can be found in the release section on github.

Check the CHANGELOG.md file to see what has been added in this version.

> Make sure to stop all running auto-crafting tasks before upgrading!
